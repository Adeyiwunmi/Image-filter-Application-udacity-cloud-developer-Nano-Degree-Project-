This is my image filter application , one of the projects my Udacity Cloud Developer NanoDegree requires me to complete.
It is a service that filters an image given the image URL.

**Testing**
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to start your development server.
- Test the endpoint http://localhost:8082/filteredimage?image_url={{IMAGE_URL}} with an image URL and you would get a filtered version of the image as a response.

- To Deploy on AWS EBS, you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_nodejs.html) .
